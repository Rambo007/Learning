			<h1>Story no.1</h1>
			<p>One day a man said to Nasruddin, "I've heard you've got vinegar that is 40 years old". That is true," said Hodja."Will you give me some?" asked the man. "If I gave vinegar to all those who asked, it wouldn't have become 40 years old," said Hodja. </p>
			<p>Nasruddin Hodja was trying to raise a fire by blowing at the glowing embers of coal in the fireplace. All he succeeded in doing was to produce a thick cloud of smoke that stung his eyes. He put on his wife's cap to prevent the smoke from getting into his eyes and started blowing again. This time flames leaped up from the coal. "Ahha!" said Hodja. "So you too are afraid of my wife." </p>
